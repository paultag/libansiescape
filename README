libansi
=======

libansi is a library that is able to parse ANSI escape sequences (but mostly
for reading CSI ANSI sequences) in a clean, well written way. This is mostly
intended for those who are creating their own VTE, or if you want to abstract
away some of the messy parsing to something (or someone) else.

This spec is so close to being trivial to parse in a clean way, but there are
a few small edge cases that are a pain. This should let you, fair hacker, not
care.
