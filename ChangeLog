* Refactored the build process. Sync'd the buildprocess with libshibuya, we now
have a fairly common build system. This will make maintaining the two much more
simple.

* Releasing 1.2.
* Debugging changes, some bugfixes and a new superclass that will let us check
for basic memory leak stuff.

* Releasing 1.1.
* Found a slight error with the ansi CSI defs in the header. This is only decent
change.

* Releasing 1.0. It's not ready and it has known bugs, but in the spirit of 
release early release often, it's game on. Patches will come in after Shibuya
starts getting implemented.

* Initial ChangeLog Entry. I've begun keeping track of this stuff, for the sake
of new hackers or whatever. We'll see how long I can keep up with this.
